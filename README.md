## What aircraft should our business purchase?

Safety is our businesses top priority. So how do we find an aircraft that can reach our safety standard? Today we are using the National Transportation Safety Board Accident Database to gather informatin on aircraft incidents. 

## What metrics will we use to identify a safe aircraft?

There are 3 main metrics we will use, including:

Engine count
-single engine vs dual engine

fatality rate

accommodations in the event of an incident 
-exit count 

## Engine count

engine count plays a huge roll in an aircrafts safety. increasing the engine count from 1 to 2 causes a 66% reduction in indcidents.

## Fatality rate

We will only be considering aircraft that has an extremely low fatality rate

## Incident accommodations 

In the event of an incident, it is important to have easy access to an exit, allowing for a quick escape of a dangerous situation.

## conclusion

With these metrics in mind, three candidates have taken the spotlight:

Recommendation 1:

Airbus A330. extremely low incidents rate with dual turbo fan engines. medium capacity and fairly quiet when compared to other aircraft.

Recommendation 2:

Boeing 747. moderatly low incidnet rate with quad turbo fans. Large capacity.

Recommendation 3:

Cessna Latitude. Smaller size business jet with no reported fatalities. dual turbo fan allowing for redundancey.
