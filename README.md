## What aircraft should our business purchase?

Safety is our businesses top priority. So how do we find an aircraft that can reach our safety standard? Today we are using the National Transportation Safety Board Accident Database to gather informatin on aircraft incidents. 

## What metrics will we use to identify a safe aircraft?

There are 3 main metrics we will use, including:

Engine count
  single engine vs dual engine

fatality rate

accommodations in the event of an incident 
  exit count 

## Engine count

engine count plays a huge roll in an aircrafts safety. increasing the engine count from 1 to 2 causes a 66% reduction in indcidents.
