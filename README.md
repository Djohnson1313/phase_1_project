## Overview

In this repository, we take a look at the National Transportaion Safety Board Data Sheet involving aircraft incidents from 1962 onward. This data sheet contains 88889 entries, with 31 columns.  

## Business undertanding 

Safety is this business's top priority, so what plane can meet our standards? We will use 3 main metrics to determine what plane should be purchased. These metrics are : Engine Count, Engine Type and Purpose of Flight.

## Engine count

engine count plays a huge roll in an aircrafts safety. increasing the engine count from 1 to 2 causes a 66% reduction in indcidents.

## Engine Type

The type of engine drastically alters an aircrafts safety capability

## Purpose of Flight

The purpose of the flight has more of an impact then you would think. Things like a professional crew for a commcercial aircraft vs an amateur pilot in a small size aircraft drastically alters the safety of the flight.

## conclusion

With these metrics in mind, three candidates have taken the spotlight:

Recommendation 1:

- Airbus A330.
  - Extremely low incidents rate with dual turbo fan engines.
  - Medium capacity and fairly quiet when compared to other aircraft.

Recommendation 2:

- Boeing 747.
  - Moderatly low incidnet rate with quad turbo fans.
  - Large capacity.

Recommendation 3:

- Cessna Latitude.
  - Smaller size business jet with no reported fatalities.
  - Dual turbo fan allowing for redundancey.

## Disrtibution of The Data

Here we see a majority of the incidents have 0 fatalities, nearly 80 % to be exact. while there are a few outliers, most flights are extremely safe in the modern erra.
