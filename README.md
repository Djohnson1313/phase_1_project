## Overview

In this repository, we take a look at the National Transportaion Safety Board Data Sheet involving aircraft incidents from 1962 onward. This data sheet contains 88889 entries, with 31 columns.  

## Business undertanding 

Safety is this business's top priority, so what plane can meet our standards? We will use 3 main metrics to determine what plane should be purchased. These metrics are : Engine count, Engine type and Accomidations in the event of an incident.

## Engine count

engine count plays a huge roll in an aircrafts safety. increasing the engine count from 1 to 2 causes a 66% reduction in indcidents.

## Engine Type

The type of engine drastically alters an aircrafts safety capability 

## Incident accommodations 

In the event of an incident, it is important to have easy access to an exit, allowing for a quick escape of a dangerous situation, as well as slides to exit the tall aircraft, and airmasks in the event of an incident mid flight.



## conclusion

With these metrics in mind, three candidates have taken the spotlight:

Recommendation 1:

Airbus A330. extremely low incidents rate with dual turbo fan engines. medium capacity and fairly quiet when compared to other aircraft.

Recommendation 2:

Boeing 747. moderatly low incidnet rate with quad turbo fans. Large capacity.

Recommendation 3:

Cessna Latitude. Smaller size business jet with no reported fatalities. dual turbo fan allowing for redundancey.
